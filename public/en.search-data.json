For example, add an image file image.png alongside the my-page.md file:\ncontent docs my-page.md image.png Then, we can use the following Markdown syntax to add the image to the content:\ncontent/docs/my-page.md![](image.png) We can also utilize the page bundles feature of Hugo to organize the image files together with the Markdown file. To achieve that, turn the my-page.md file into a directory my-page and put the content into a file named index.md, and put the image files inside the my-page directory:\ncontent docs my-page index.md image.png content/docs/my-page/index.md![](image.png) Alternatively, we can also put the image files in the static directory, which will make the images available for all pages:\nstatic images image.png content docs my-page.md Note that the image path begins with a slash / and is relative to the static directory:\ncontent/docs/my-page.md![](/images/image.png) ","configure-content-directory#Configure Content Directory":"By default, the root content/ directory is used by Hugo to build the site.
